# Coding problems

I do coding problems sometimes - I've decided to dump mine in this repository 
so I can look at them later if I need and example of how to do something that 
I know I understand.

### Subdirectories

Each directory has a slightly different structure

`exercism` is problems from [exercism.io](https://www.exercism.io)

Exercism is great, it has a command line tool which neatly downloads 
the tests and readmes into a folder. As such - the folder structure is 
better.
```
.
└── language
    └── task
        ├── README.md
        ├── solution.lang
        ├── test.lang
        └── other.files
```

`tl` is problems from [techseries.dev](https://www.techseries.dev/daily)

These are copied and pasted from somewhere I don't quite remember. I don't 
tend to do these often.
```
└── problem
    ├── README.md
    └── main.lang
```

`codewars` is problems from [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com)

These are copied and pasted from the website. This is more of a dumping 
ground. Each solution contains a link to the kata. `kyu` is a measure 
of difficulty used by the site. Smaller number is harder.
```
└── language
    └── kyu
        ├── 6
        │   └── harder_problem.lang
        ├── 7
        │   └── problem_title.lang
        └── 8
            └── easier_problem.lang
```

Exercism is a clear favourite for me.
