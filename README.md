# Coding problems

I do coding problems sometimes - I've decided to dump mine in this repository 
so I can look at them later if I need and example of how to do something that 
I know I understand.

### Subdirectories

`exercism` is problems from exercism.io

`tl` is problems from [techseries.dev](https://www.techseries.dev/daily)

`codewars` is problems from codewars.com

Exercism is a clear favourite for me.
